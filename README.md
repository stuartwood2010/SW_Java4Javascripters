  ## Description
    Welcome to our store. We are Java 4 JavaScripters, a Denver, CO based software development team. We have created this application for a mock e-commerce store, one that sells coffee and coffee products. With the app, you can view our store of products and add what you'd like to purchase to your shopping cart. Once you create a login and sign in, you can proceed to checkout your shopping cart. The cart checkout is a  functionality for deploymment only, please do not use your sensitive information.

  ## Installation
    You will need MongoDB, Express, React, and Node to run the application locally. Run npm install to import the required dependencies from Node. 

  ## Usage
    You may shop the store without being logged in. However, to purchase items you must create a login. The login process is authenticated and secure. Once you navigate to the store page, click on an item to add it to your cart. You may adjust the quantity in your order or remove an item from your cart completely. When you are ready to purchase you order, click the checkout button to be directed to the checkout page. The checkout process is encoded and fully authenticated.
